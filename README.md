# Optimize-LM-Instructions
Optimize instruction/pormpt we send to Reasoning Models, via systematic programming

Improve accuracy of responses from Reasoning Models:
via ‘prompt optimization’

    1. Systemic optimization of the prompts we send to LRM (large reasoning models), should deliver better accuracy for the final decision;
    2. Proposing and intelligently exploring better natural-language instructions for every prompt;
    3. This process makes the program robust across different language models and allows us to re-compile and re-optimize if our data or goals change, without rewriting the core logic.
